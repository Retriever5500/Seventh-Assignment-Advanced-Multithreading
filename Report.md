# Introduction:

 The purpose of the assignment is to get to know and use advanced multi threading concepts.

# Design and Implementation

 For PiCalculator, the Machin formula was used and calculated till 1000th term, which gives more than 1000 digit accuracy.
 For Semaphore, well Semaphore was used.
 For Piority simulator, CountDownLatch was used.

# Testing
 For PiCalculator and Piority Simulator, all unit tests have been passed. For Semaphore, the code in main function works as expected.

# Conclusion

 We learned how we can solve some problems that multi threading introduces
